                    <p class="mb-0">"I’ve studied NT Greek using the “grammar-translation” method for years, but this communicative course was fantastic for me. This method enables students to actually internalize the language and think of it as a real language, not as a mathematical code to be cracked. I highly recommend it for everyone–from beginners to those who’ve studied Greek grammars and done parsing exercises for years. Five stars."</p>

            <h3>Tuition</h3>
            <p>Sign up for as much or as little of the Biblical Greek Program as you want to participate in. However, every Level has the previous Levels as prerequisites.</p>
            <p>When you sign up for Year 1, you are signing up for two immersion courses and one online course. Those two immersion courses and that one online course are roughly equivalent to two college semesters. These three components constitute one full year of Greek. Year 2 is similar to Year 1. By signing up for Year 2 you are signing up for two online courses and one immersion course at the end.</p>
