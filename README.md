# Project 0

This project is an assignment for the class Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

The general contents of this project is adapted from my [Biblical Greek Program](https://biblicalgreekprogram.org) website though none of the code has come from that site. 

Each page contains a `nav` and a `div.footer` which are identical on each page. Each page also contains a `div.main` in which the unique content of each page is placed.
