            <p class="mb-0">"The communicative language-learning approach is not only effective for the learning of
                modern languages but also for ancient languages such as Koine Greek. Through intentional “child’s
                play” and storytelling, the student interacts with the language on multiple fronts, including
                listening, reading, and speaking. Instead of laborious grammars and endless paradigms, “normal”
                interaction becomes the means of entering the language of the New Testament. This does not mean that
                the course does not have sessions dedicated to grammar points; rather, grammar is largely taught in
                the context of speaking Greek. This method makes the learning of Biblical Greek accessible to all,
                regardless of age, who are willing to engage in the rigors of language learning."</p>
